      "description": "This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage roll made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\n\nSix Buttons: You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n\nIf you press button 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head.\n\nIf you press button 2, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nIf you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nIf you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n\nIf you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and gram its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\n\nIf you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\n\nDrain Life: When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target rakes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nParalyze: When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nTerrify: While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n(Requires Attunement)",

The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.\n\n• As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one Undead is within that area. Any Undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.\n\n• As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have Resistance to fire damage.\n\n• As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a Command Word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an Attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a Bonus Action to speak the Command Word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.\n\nRoll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.\n(Requires Attunement)",
